# debug mode

If the program is run with the -d flag, that puts it into debug mode. In this mode, the user must type in which pet they want to load in the terminal & pressing the quit option in the menu will NOT restart the board. Otherwise, it will!

Note: in our narrative, the bbg power button would not exist on our device. Instead, the power button of the beagle-gotchi would be hooked up to our service, and reboots immediately, only after freeing neccesary data & turning off the display.
